This work creates a prototype program that recreates vehicular collisions with data collected from a black box with an IMU and GPS. The program was created using Unity and is capable of getting data from the black box and recreating the movements of a vehicle with good precision. This project can yield better results by improving the quality of the filters used to estimate position, improving the quality of the raw data or using another method for estimating position, like AI.
