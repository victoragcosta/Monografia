	title = {An eﬃcient orientation ﬁlter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays},
	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

The sensors used in this system are accelerometer MMA7260QT and gyroscope GS-12. The system chooses the arbitrary sampling time and then it is evaluated for possible using smaller value. As the Kalman Filter operation needs matrix calculation, the formula is converted into several ordinary equations. The parameter being investigated in this paper is measurement covariance matrix. This parameter influences the way the Kalman Filter responses to noise. Bigger value makes the Kalman Filter less sensitive to noise and the estimation is too smooth, thus it does not give real angle estimation. Using smaller value makes the Kalman Filter more sensitive to noise. This makes the estimated angle still suffers from noise and it is likely that the Kalman Filter is useless. This paper recommends 0.0001 to 0.001 for the measurement covariance noise parameter. This paper also recommended a pipeline configuration if the control algorithm needs more space in a sampling time.},

A nonlinear complementary ﬁlter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component for the airframe acceleration, that occurs primarily as the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the ﬁlter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a ﬁrst order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the ﬁlter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},

In this paper, a heading estimation method with real-time compensation based on Kalman filter has been proposed, abbreviated as KHD. For the KHD method, a unified heading error model is established for various predictable errors in magnetic compass for pedestrian navigation, and an effective method for solving the model parameters is proposed in the indoor environment with regular structure. In addition, error model parameters are solved by Kalman filtering algorithm with building geometry information in order to achieve real-time heading compensation. The experimental results show that the KHD method can not only effectively correct the original heading information, but also effectively inhibit the accumulation effect of positioning errors. The performance observed in a field experiment performed on the fourth floor of the School of Environmental Science and Spatial Informatics (SESSI) building on the China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT) campus confirms that apply KHD method to PDR(Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) algorithm can reliably achieve meter-level positioning using a low cost MEMS IMU only.},

	doi = {10.1017/S037346330400270X},
	abstract = {Attitude estimation systems often use two or more different sensors to increase reliability and accuracy. Although gyroscopes do not have problems like limited range, interference, and line of sight obscuration, they suffer from slow drift. On the other hand, inclinometers are drift-free but they are sensitive to transverse accelerations and have slow dynamics. This paper presents an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based data fusion algorithm which utilizes the complementary noise profiles of these two types of sensors to extend their limits. To avoid complexities of dynamic modelling of the platform and its interaction with the environment, gyro modelling will be used to implement indirect (error state) form of the Kalman filter. The great advantage of this approach is its independence from the structure of the platform and its applicability to any system with a similar set of sensors. Separate bias formulation of the Kalman filter will be used to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. In addition, a systematic approach based on wavelet decomposition will be util-ized to estimate noise covariances used in the Kalman filter formulation. This approach solves many of the convergence problems encountered in the implementation of EKF due to the choice of covariance matrices. Experimental implementation of the estimator shows the excellent performance of the filter. K E Y W O R D S 1. Attitude Estimation. 2. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). 3.

	title = {A new magnetic compass calibration algorithm using neural networks},
	volume = {17},
	doi = {10.1088/0957-0233/17/1/025},
	abstract = {The magnetic compass can provide heading direction by measuring the Earth's magnetic field. In practical applications, there usually exists an unwanted local magnetic field that will distort the magnetometer measurements; hence a calibration procedure is essential. Current calibration methods are limited by the inaccurate magnetometer error estimation when measurements are deteriorated by magnetic disturbances or large noises. This paper proposes a new compass calibration algorithm via modelling the nonlinear relationship between the compass heading and the true heading using neural networks. When an external heading reference is available, neural networks can be trained to properly model this nonlinear input–output pattern even in the presence of magnetic disturbances, and subsequently can be applied to convert the compass heading into the correct heading. The proposed algorithm does not require declination information and magnetometer biases and scale factor estimation. The simulation and field test results have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed calibration method and have also shown that the calibration performance is proportional to the quality of the training data.},

	The second example demonstrates another common use of Kalman filters, in which you can optimally estimate the state of a system (e.g., the position of a car) by fusing measurements from multiple sources (e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU), an odometer, and a GPS receiver) in the presence of noisy measurements.},

	Errata:
	{\textasciitilde}2:23 - I state that the accelerometer is measuring the acceleration due to gravity, when in fact it's measuring the acceleration caused by the normal force from the ground.  So it's directly up and the exact opposite direction of gravity! Whereas, an accelerometer in free fall would measure no acceleration at all even though it would be accelerating.  So the "convert to angle" block would also take care of this sign flip.

	This video describes how we can use a magnetometer, accelerometer, and a gyro to estimate an object’s orientation. The goal is to show how these sensors contribute to the solution, and to explain a few things to watch out for along the way.
	
	We’ll cover what orientation is and how we can determine orientation using an accelerometer and a magnetometer. We’ll also talk about calibrating a magnetometer for hard and soft iron sources and ways to deal with corrupting accelerations.
	
	We’ll also show a simple dead reckoning solution that uses the gyro on its own. Finally, we’ll cover the concept of blending the solutions from the three sensors.

	This video provides an overview of what sensor fusion is and how it helps in the design of autonomous systems. It also covers a few scenarios that illustrate the various ways that sensor fusion can be implemented.
	
	Sensor fusion is a critical part of localization and positioning, as well as detection and object tracking. We’ll show that sensor fusion is more than just a Kalman filter; it is a whole range of algorithms that can blend data from multiple sources to get a better estimate of the system state. Four of the main benefits of sensor fusion are to improve measurement quality, reliability, and coverage, as well as be able to estimate states that aren’t measure directly. The fact that sensor fusion has this broad appeal across completely different types of autonomous systems is what makes it an interesting and rewarding topic to learn.
